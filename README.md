Hi there!

I'm Matt. I am a full stack developer with a current focus on workflow automation and creating integrations between systems. 

The tools I most commonly use include

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img alt="react" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img alt=".net" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=.net&logoColor=white" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img alt="bootstrap" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%238511FA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img alt="express.js" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB" />
      </td>
</table>

Programming, to me, is a way to be creative while solving puzzles. I love that there's always something new to learn, a new way of looking at/doing things, and always someone with a new perspective. 

Thanks for stopping by!
